# BiolSys-Spatial_signalomics
This repository contains results of an analysis of spatial signalomics data. It consits of two files:
  - pdf report with results and their interpretation
  - ipynb file to reproduce the results.
  <!-- -->
Note: the ipynb file uses plotly for visualisation which makes the file large. For the same reason some of the plots may not load when opening the file and it may be necessary to rerun the code.
